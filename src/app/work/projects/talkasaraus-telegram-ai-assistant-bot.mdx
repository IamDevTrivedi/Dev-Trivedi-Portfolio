## Overview

Talkasaraus is a friendly, general-purpose AI assistant built as a Telegram bot. Powered by Google's Gemini 2.0, it understands and responds to users in natural language. It supports persistent conversation history, intelligent follow-ups, and a suite of utility commands designed for seamless user interaction.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language AI**: Conversational capabilities backed by Gemini 2.0 for smooth, human-like dialogue.
- **Persistent Chat History**: Stores user interaction history in MongoDB for context-aware conversations.
- **Utility Commands**:
  - `/start`: Initialize and start interacting with the bot
  - `/help`: Display help documentation
  - `/temporary_start`: Initiate a temporary chat session
  - `/temporary_end`: End the temporary session that automatically closes after 5 minutes of inactivity
  - `/current_mode`: Show current mode of operation
  - `/clear`: Clear your conversation history
  - `/feedback`: Submit feedback to the developer
  - `/contact`: Get in touch with the developer

## Technologies Used

- **Telegram Bot API**: For building conversational bot interactions.
- **Gemini 2.0 API**: Google's advanced AI model for NLP and response generation.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for building the backend logic.
- **Telegraf.js**: Framework for managing the Telegram bot.
- **MongoDB**: Database for persisting user messages and session history.

## Challenges and Learnings

Maintaining coherent follow-up responses across sessions required a persistent, efficient state management system. Implementing flexible session modes and crafting an intuitive command structure helped improve usability. Working with Gemini's API for conversational context highlighted the importance of prompt engineering and error handling in bot UX.

## Outcome

Talkasaraus is now live and serves as a helpful, AI-powered assistant on Telegram. It offers natural interaction, remembers past conversations, and assists users across a range of casual and productive scenarios.
