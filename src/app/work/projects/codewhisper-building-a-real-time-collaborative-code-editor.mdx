## Overview

CodeWhisper is a collaborative coding platform I developed that enables developers to write, share, and collaborate on code in real-time. The project features a authentication system, multi-language support, and AI-powered code assistance. CodeWhisper was recognized as the winning project in DA-IICT Microsoft Club's Winter of Code 7.0 competition ([Proof](https://winter-of-code-seven.vercel.app/winners)), validating its technical merit and practical utility.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Implemented Socket.IO to enable multiple developers to work simultaneously on the same codebase, with real-time updates visible to all participants.
- **Custom Authentication System**: Built a secure user authentication flow with JWT, email verification, and password recovery to protect user accounts and projects.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Integrated Monaco Editor to provide support for numerous programming languages with advanced syntax highlighting.
- **File Management System**: Developed functionality for creating, editing, uploading, and downloading files, with persistent storage tied to user accounts.
- **AI Code Assistant**: Integrated Google's Gemini API to provide intelligent code assistance during development enhancing productivity.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Three.js, Monaco Editor, Socket.IO client, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose, Socket.IO, JWT authentication
- **UI Libraries**: Acernity UI, shadCN, Ant Design, Material UI, Framer Motion
- **Additional Tools**: Nodemailer for email services, bcryptjs for encryption

## Outcome

CodeWhisper has been deployed as a fully functional web application . The platform successfully bridges the gap between individual coding environments and collaborative development, making it particularly valuable for remote teams and educational settings. Being selected as the winning project at Winter of Code 7.0 demonstrated its effectiveness in addressing real-world development needs.
